                As the executive director of a nonprofit public benefit organization I have 
                found that the service and support from the City Print and Mail has been 
                exceptional. From helping me with design issues to guiding our projects to 
                completion, the staff of City Print and Mail have been wonderful to work with.

                Hi Harry,
                <br/>
                Just wanted to let you know the Postcards are a hit with people here in the 
                office.  Between Karen's design and your new coating on the card, it really 
                gets a lot of notice.  Keep up the good work!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Thanks,
                <br/>

                Harry,
                <br/>
                Thank you so much for the chocolates and for bringing over the leftover 
                supplies. It was so nice to finally meet Calvin and I hope we're able to 
                connect someday soon as well.  You've been such a wonderfully helpful 
                group to work with.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I hope you had a fabulous holiday!
                <br/>

                Calvin,
                <br/>
                Your work is wonderful. Yours and Harry's attitude (you are the only two I 
                have had the pleasure of speaking with) is wonderful. Results are 
                wonderful.  I guess that you can say that you are doing WONDERFUL!
                Actually, I just had a pretty bad experience with one of my clients and 
                another mailing house, so the next time that they need a mailing, we will be 
                moving it over to you.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Thank you for all your hard work and getting the jobs done on time.
                <br/>
